# Security

arizuko's security model and boundaries. Daemons with non-trivial
surface ship their own `SECURITY.md` next to the source; this file is
the index and cross-cutting model.

## Model

Three isolation axes:

1. **Group isolation** — per-group bind mounts; no path inside one
   group's container resolves to another group's files or sockets.
2. **User isolation** — users reach groups only via `acl` allow rows
   (directly or through `acl_membership`). OAuth → JWT at the proxy
   edge; `auth.Authorize` enforces.
3. **Daemon isolation** — adapters reach gated only over the internal
   docker network with a shared `CHANNEL_SECRET` bearer token.

### The group is the tenant boundary

The isolation unit in arizuko is the **group**, not the turn. Each
group runs in its own Docker container with its own filesystem, its
own network namespace, its own DB view, and its own egress allowlist.
`solo/inbox` and `corp/eng` cannot see each other's files, sockets,
network state, or messages — and this is structural, enforced by
docker + bind mounts + MCP folder scoping, not by policy inside the
agent.

What's isolated per group:

- **Filesystem** — only `groups/<folder>/` mounts at `/home/node/`;
  `groupfolder.Resolver` rejects `..` and reserved paths
  (`groupfolder/folder.go`, `container/runner.go` `buildMounts`).
- **Network namespace** — agent container attaches to a Docker
  `internal: true` network with no default route; egress passes
  through `crackbox` against the per-folder allowlist
  (`container/egress.go`, `crackbox/`).
- **DB view** — the MCP socket at `ipc/<folder>/gated.sock` carries
  the group's identity (`SO_PEERCRED` + socket-path tier); every
  tool call resolves through `auth.Authorize` against that folder,
  not the caller's claim (`ipc/ipc.go`, `auth/middleware.go`).
- **Secrets** — AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest; only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from host env reach the container.
  Folder/user secret injection deferred to spec 6/Y.

The threat the model defends against is a malicious agent in group A
trying to reach group B's data, files, or network. Separate containers
on separate networks with separate DB views close that path
structurally. The agent runs with `bypassPermissions` inside its own
container by design — the boundary is the mount set and the network
namespace, not what the agent decides to do with its shell.

Per-turn (or per-spawn) container freshness solves a different
problem: a compromised turn affecting the next turn in the **same**
group. arizuko's group containers are long-lived precisely because
the conversation state, diary, skills, and session jsonl live in
`/home/node/` and need to persist across turns. Per-turn isolation
would destroy that context; per-group isolation is what makes the
cross-tenant threat go away.

Anything not in this table is not a security boundary. In particular:
socket filesystem permissions alone do not separate containers, and
host root always wins — arizuko does not defend against the host
operator. The agent container runs with `bypassPermissions`; the
boundary is the mount set, not the tool policy.

### Public vs private web tree separation

`<data>/web/pub/` and `<data>/web/priv/` are **separate filesystem
trees**. `/pub/<X>` URLs are public (no auth) and never serve from
`web/priv/`; `/priv/<X>` URLs require a valid JWT (via proxyd) and
never serve from `web/pub/`. Each group's container bind-mounts its
own slot into `~/public_html/` (public tree) and `~/private_html/`
(private tree); content cannot leak from one to the other except by
the agent explicitly copying bytes. Full model:
`specs/5/V-web-vhosts.md`.

## Identity header trust

`proxyd` is the **sole signer** of identity headers
(`X-User-Sub`, `X-User-Name`, `X-User-Groups`, `X-User-Sig`).
Every other HTTP-receiving backend MUST verify the signature via the
centralized middleware in `auth/middleware.go`:

- `auth.RequireSigned(secret)` — strict, redirect-on-fail. Use on
  always-authed backends (e.g. `webd/server.go:44` constructs it once
  and stamps it on every private route).
- `auth.StripUnsigned(secret)` — lenient, scrub-spoofed-and-continue.
  Use on backends mixing public + authed flows (e.g. `onbod/main.go:81`
  protects `/onboard` and `/invite/{token}` so unauthenticated landings
  still work but a forged `X-User-Sub` never reaches a handler).

The shared secret is `PROXYD_HMAC_SECRET` in `.env`. It must be set
and **identical** in both `proxyd` and `webd` (and `onbod`). The
compose generator propagates it from `.env` to each service's scoped
`env/<daemon>.env`. If unset, proxyd generates an ephemeral secret
per run — webd will then reject all signed headers, breaking ant link
SSE auth and authenticated web chat.

Crypto lives in `auth/hmac.go` (`SignHMAC`, `VerifyUserSig`,
`UserSigMessage`) and is shared by both signer and verifiers. Never
inline a `VerifyUserSig` call in handler code — go through the
middleware. The single exception is in `webd/slink.go` where signed
identity is one of two acceptable identities (the other being
anonymous-from-trusted-IP); even there, the call is a boolean
"is this user known?" check, not an authentication gate.

## Network egress isolation

When `CRACKBOX_ADMIN_API` is set and `crackbox:latest` is running,
agent containers attach to a Docker `internal: true` network with no
default route to the internet. The only path out is via `crackbox`,
which runs on both the internal network and the project default bridge.

- Agent containers receive `HTTPS_PROXY=http://crackbox:3128` at spawn
  plus `NODE_OPTIONS=--require=/app/proxy-shim.js` so Node's built-in
  fetch honors the proxy (curl/wget/pip/go/npm honor it natively).
  crackbox forwards HTTP and CONNECT-tunnels HTTPS without decrypting.
- Non-cooperating clients fail closed: the internal Docker network
  has no default route, so a client that ignores `HTTPS_PROXY` cannot
  reach the internet at all.
- Per-source-IP allowlist populated by gated at container spawn from
  `store.ResolveAllowlist(folder)` (folder ancestry walk + dedupe).
- Default seed: `anthropic.com`, `api.anthropic.com`. Operators add
  rules via `arizuko network <instance> allow <folder> <target>`.
- Unknown source IP or unmatched host → connection closed silently.
- Egress wildcard (`"*"`) is appended only for tier ≤ 1 agents.
  Tier-2 agents are not granted the wildcard; they are subject to the
  per-folder allowlist like any other tier.

Caveats:

- Only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from host env
  are injected into the container today. The allowlist restricts _where_
  the agent can reach; it does not prevent leaking secrets to an allowed
  domain.
- Spec 6/Y (tool-level secret broker) is **planned, not yet shipped**:
  the broker middleware (`ipc/ipc.go` `injectSecretsAdapter`) will resolve
  `user(caller.Sub)` then `folder(caller.Folder)` at tool-call time;
  audit rows will flow into `secret_use_log`; per-user secrets will
  never enter container env. The connector path (`mcp_connector` TOML +
  per-call subprocess) and `/dash/me/secrets` user surface are part of
  the same spec. OAuth-bound connector flows deferred to spec 9/14.
- IPv6 is not redirected by the entrypoint script.

**DNS filter** (`crackbox/pkg/dns/`,
`specs/10/15-crackbox-dns-filter.md`). The crackbox-side UDP/53
listener is shipped: gated allowlisted hostnames forward to the
upstream resolver; denied hostnames return NXDOMAIN; `QTYPE=ANY`
returns REFUSED; malformed/multi-question packets drop silently.
**Pending:** arizuko-side wiring (passing `--dns <crackbox-ip>` from
`container.Run` to `docker create`) under
`specs/10/10-crackbox-arizuko.md`; today agent containers still use
the default Docker resolver, so the DNS path is additive defense
rather than the primary gate. The HTTP/CONNECT 403 in
`crackbox/pkg/proxy/` remains the enforced path.

## Per-daemon docs

- [`ipc/SECURITY.md`](ipc/SECURITY.md) — MCP channel, `SO_PEERCRED`
  check, per-group mount isolation, incident history

Other daemons do not have a dedicated file yet; guarantees are in the
table above. Add one next to the daemon when its threat model outgrows
a row.

## Audit trail and logging

All daemons log structured JSON to stdout (Go `slog` JSON handler).
Docker log driver is `none`; containers run attached under their
systemd unit, so stdout flows directly into journald.

Single command to read all service logs for an instance:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u arizuko_<instance> --since "1 hour ago" --no-pager
```

**Access audit**: `proxyd` is the single ingress point for all HTTP
traffic. It logs every request as a structured JSON line:

```json
{
  "time": "...",
  "level": "INFO",
  "msg": "request",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/dash/",
  "status": 200,
  "dur": "1.2ms",
  "actor_sub": "u:alice",
  "remote": "1.2.3.4"
}
```

`actor_sub` is the authenticated identity (empty for public routes).
Because all traffic passes through `proxyd` before reaching webd,
dashd, vited, or davd, this log is the authoritative access record —
no per-backend access logging is required.

**Do not use `docker logs`** — the `none` log driver means Docker has
no stored logs. `journalctl` is the only source.

## Incident log

**2026-04-17 → 2026-04-19 — MCP token preamble outage.** Commit
`2774394` added a server-side token preamble to `ipc.ServeMCP` with no
matching client (ant's socat bridge cannot write a preamble). Every MCP
call rejected for ~48h; agents appeared amnesic. Fixed v0.29.3 (disable)
and replaced v0.29.4 with `SO_PEERCRED`. Full writeup:
[`ipc/SECURITY.md`](ipc/SECURITY.md).

## Reporting

Log to `bugs.md` with reproducer and severity. No public channel —
arizuko is single-operator per instance.
